The only one job typescript got for you is Static Checking.

what typescript does: "Static Checking"

TypeScript is just for Static Checking. Its just anylyzing you code and help you to understand that you might be running into a potential error without even running the code and getting the error in running time itself

                    Analyze the code as we type. Tht's it.

How it works:::

you will create a ts file and the code you will write will be converted/compile/tranpiled into js thats it .

/// give ctrl+I and tell copilot to write more about it


            Always Remember

TS it's a development tool. Your projects still runs JS.Its still pure 100% Js code .

So typescript is just layer on top of js. Just to provide the typesafety.(Its a superset of JS)

Also you can tell it a development tool. Thats helps you to write better code with less problem with a more scaleable and maintainable code that is easily understandable. And the chances of producing error is much more less. its just a wrapper around the js. (its not a whole new language)
